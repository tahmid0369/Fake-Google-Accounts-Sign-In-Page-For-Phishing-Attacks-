# Phishing Awareness Simulation â€” Brief Introduction

This is a specification and feature roadmap for an ethical and approved phishing-awareness simulation platform. The purpose is to provide educational training to users to increase security awareness and reduce risk; no real credentials will be collected and the platform is designed to be used in approved environments only.

# Main Objective

To monitor inappropriate click rates and reporting patterns of employees or users and provide educational feedback.

To provide risk-based training and follow-up micro-learning.

# Key Feature Set

1. Campaign Manager â€” Templates, schedules, and approved audience configurations.

2. Training Landing-Page Template â€” Redirects directly to educational materials when the user fills out a written form; no passwords/credentials will be stored.

3. Real-time event tracking â€” Clicks, reports, and other anonymized metrics will be logged (passwords will not be saved).

4. Risk scoring and custom follow-up training â€” Send automated training based on user feedback.

5. Consent and compliance controls â€” Written consent, notice templates, and data-retention policies.

6. Auditable logging â€” No sensitive information will be collected; logs will only contain customized, anonymized metrics.

7. Integration options â€” SSO/LDAP verification (for whitelist verification only), optional SIEM integration.

# Architecture (high level)

Frontend: Templated landing pages, admin dashboard

Backend: Campaign schedulers, event-logging service (anonymization mode), risk-scoring microservices

Database: Metrics and audit-trail; no credentials or full form-inputs will be logged

Security: TLS, key-based encryption, role-based access control

# Policies and legal disciplines

Run only on authorized groups; written consent/notice will be enforced before each test.

Clearly state data-retention and privacy policies; passwords or sensitive inputs cannot be stored.

Coordination with locker/legal team and HR is essential; government logos or third-party identities cannot be spoofed.

# Best practices

Tests cannot be used punitively; Incorrect clicks will be managed through learning-rest.

Inform relevant stakeholders (CISO, IT, HR) in advance and have a roll-out plan.

The NIST Phish Scale can be adapted for analyzing the results to understand email-difficulty and staff-risk.

Deployment and configuration guidelines (brief)

1. Run tests first in a staging environment and obtain legal/HR approval.

2. Landing-page templates should have clear notices (show learning-material on the feedback page at the end of the event).

3. Logging configuration: Store only event type, timestamp and anonymized user-id; do not store input content.

4. Schedule regular audits and scans (security reviews).

# Contributor Guidelines

Customized documentation must be added to the PR before adding new campaign templates or training modules.

Code-style and security checklists are attached for contributors (running security rules in CI tests is mandatory).
